# Nixed: Rust Development Environment

This is the default [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) template in [Nixed](https://github.com/Craole/Nixed) series of templates. It's a good starting point for new Rust projects with several utilities made available that aim to enhance developer experience.

## Installation

This template is designed to be deployed via nix flakes but is also available as a standalone package but with limited features. You can install it via:

> With nix flakes

```shell
  #| New Directory
  nix flake new --template github:Craole/nixed#rust ${project_name}

  #| Existing Directory
  nix flake init --template github:Craole/nixed#rust

```

> Without nix flakes

```shell
  # create a new directory for your project
  project_name="rusty_nail"
  mkdir ${project_name}
  cd ${project_name}

  # initialize a new git repository
  git init

  # add the nixed repository as a remote
  # this will allow you to pull the template from nixed
  git remote add origin https://github.com/Craole/nixed.git

  # set up sparse checkout so that we only pull the template
  # and not the entire nixed repository
  git config core.sparseCheckout true

  # specify which files we want to pull
  echo "export/dev/rust/*" > .git/info/sparse-checkout

  # pull the template
  git pull origin master

  # create a temporary directory
  mkdir -p temp

  # move the template files into the temporary directory
  mv export/dev/rust/* temp/

  # delete the export directory
  # this is the directory that contains the template
  # we don't need it anymore
  rm -rf export

  # move the files from the temporary directory to the current directory
  mv temp/* .

  # delete the temporary directory
  rmdir temp

  # source the init script
  # this will set up some environment variables
  # and create some default files
  . /.config/init.sh
```
