# Rustly

This Rust project template is made possible through the power of Nix flakes. The template offers a no-nonsense setup for Rust development, with built-in VSCode configuration (including linting). Simply install [direnv](https://nixos.asia/en/direnv), open the project in VSCode, and follow the prompts â€” no additional setup is required.

This template utilizes [crane](https://crane.dev/) via [rust-flake](https://github.com/juspay/rust-flake), providing a streamlined experience for Rust developers.

## Getting Started

1. **Set up the development environment:**

   ```bash
   nix develop
   ```

1. **Customize the project:**

   - Update the `name` field in `Cargo.toml`.
   - Run `cargo generate-lockfile` within the Nix shell.

1. **Choose your CI strategy:**

   - There are two CI workflows available. One uses Nix (more robust but potentially slower without caching), and the other uses rustup (faster but with different trade-offs). Choose the one that best fits your needs.

## Development Workflow

This project is built with the flexibility and power of Nix flakes in mind.

- **Enter the development shell:**

  ```bash
  nix develop
  ```

- **Run the project:**

  ```bash
  nix develop -c cargo run
  ```

- **Build the project:**

  ```bash
  nix build
  ```

A [`justfile`](https://just.systems/) is included, offering Makefile-like commands that can be executed within the development shell.
